      "company": "Amazon",
      "answer": "**Situation**:\nAt my previous company, I was leading a mobile app redesign project. We had two competing priorities: implementing a highly requested feature that would take 3 months, or fixing critical UX issues affecting 40% of users that would take 1 month.\n\n**Task**:\nAs the PM, I needed to decide which direction to take, knowing that either choice would disappoint some stakeholders.\n\n**Action**:\n1. **Data Analysis**: I analyzed user feedback, support tickets, and usage data. The UX issues were causing a 25% drop-off rate in the checkout flow.\n\n2. **Impact Assessment**: \n   - New feature: Would attract new users but wouldn't help retention\n   - UX fixes: Would improve conversion by estimated 15-20%\n\n3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: I presented data to leadership showing:\n   - Current revenue loss from poor UX: $200K/month\n   - Potential gain from new feature: $50K/month (estimated)\n   - Risk of losing users to competitors due to poor experience\n\n4. **Decision**: I advocated for prioritizing UX fixes first, then the new feature.\n\n5. **Communication**: I created a clear roadmap showing:\n   - Month 1: UX fixes\n   - Months 2-4: New feature development\n   - Transparent updates to all stakeholders\n\n**Result**:\n- Checkout conversion improved by 18% within 6 weeks\n- Monthly revenue increased by $180K\n- User satisfaction score improved from 3.2 to 4.1\n- We delivered the new feature in Month 4 as promised\n- Built trust with stakeholders through transparent communication\n\n**Learning**:\n- Data-driven decisions are easier to defend\n- Short-term sacrifices can lead to long-term gains\n- Clear communication is crucial when making unpopular decisions\n- Always tie decisions back to business impact",
